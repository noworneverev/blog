## Before Start 
---
It's been a while that I kept thinking about the way that could help to reduce auditors' work and make them home earlier even in busy season. Since that I might have that ability to do it now, it's time to give it a shot.

## About me
---
I was an auditor for about a year and a half in one of the Big 4 and currently work as a programmer in another Big 4 accounting firm. I have a CPA license in my country as well.

## Suitable Applicant
---
Whoever currently employed at an accounting firm as an auditor.
Please provide the prove(business card or employee identification card), feel free if you want to cover your name. <br />

## Applied Working Papers
---
It's unlimited, any action repeatedly performed could be programmed. 

For example: 
+ the way you clean the client's trial balance is always the same before you import it into the system, 
+ dozens of Excel sheets apply the same pivot format, 
+ dozens of txt files need to be imported into the Excel, 
+ batch converting the encoding of general ledgers, 
+ combining mulitiple Excel sheets/books, 
+ the way to produce elimination entries is fixed and so on so forth.

After you submit the form, I'll assess the viability. Bascially, if the demand is not too exaggerated(like one button to finish the whole audit or review procedure), I would try my best to find a way to accomplish it.

The Excel VBA would be used the most. I'll provide you the xlsm or xlam file after I finish it. If the demand is more complicated, I'll use C#, or depands on the condition, maybe I'll show you how to use cmd or PowerShell to accomplish the demand.

## Way to Proceed

Please elaborate your demands as detailed as possible, and provide the PBC files or working papers, if needed, modify the sensitive data or company's name, the way usually used to prepare this working paper, in what case you think you could use programming to support you, and what it is look like when finished.
